          <p>
            Full-Stack Junior Developer and life-long learner. 
            I fluently speak three languages, worked on Makeup and Special Effects for Cinema 
            and TV and have a degree in Visual Arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walked into programming in the most unexpected way and I couldn"t be more grateful for it. 
            I really enjoy the constant challenges and continuous learning process it involves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently graduated from Makers Academy, where I learnt Test Driven Development, 
            Agile procedures, and Object Oriented Programming like Ruby on Rails and Javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would love to find a job as a Front-End or Full-Stack developer 
            in an environment that supports my learning so I can keep growing and become a better developer everyday. 
            Currently based in London, willing to stay, but also open to new horizons.

            This is a list of the main fields I have worked on, with a summary of the skills I developed working 
            in them. Welcome to my working life, from television sets to baking bread, 
            with a fun stop as a Christmas elf in Finland.

            <h1> Makeup, Hair and Costume </h1>
            <p>
              Perseverance, patience, attention to detail and a very strict time management and 
              organization skills are the most valuable skills I got from this part of my job experience. 
              It is also a great practice for teamwork and delegation, especially when working in big projects.

            <h1> Tourism </h1>
            <p>
              Team management, customer care and being able to react fast to any unexpected situation 
              were key skills in these roles. I had a lot of responsibility, teaching new team members, 
              big groups of customers and a tight schedule while paying attention to every detail 
              to make sure they had the best experience. On a side note, working as a translator 
              in an environment that mixes up to five different languages is a great work out for your brain!

              Communication skills, self-awareness and empathy are very important to deal with 
              problematic customers or with your coworkers and make shifts run smoothly.
